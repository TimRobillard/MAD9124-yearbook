# MAD9124 Yearbook

#### Description

Each semester, every student will get a chance to sign the MAD9124 yearbook. This is an exercise in git flow, but I'm also hoping this will server as a fun history to see who has come through this program, and what they've gone on to achieve ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

We'll place the most recent cohort at the top. Please respect the order, first come, first serve!
